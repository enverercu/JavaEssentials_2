 What Are the Methods of the Object Class and What Do They Do?
 
 It's important to know what methods the Object class contains and how they work. 
 It's also very helpful when we want to override those methods:
 
clone() – returns a copy of this object
equals() – returns true when this object is equal to the object passed as a parameter
finalize() – the garbage collector calls this method while it's cleaning the memory
getClass() – returns the runtime class of this object
hashCode() – returns a hash code of this object. We should be aware that it should be consistent with the equals() method
notify() – sends a notification to a single thread waiting for the object's monitor
notifyAll() – sends a notification to all threads waiting for the object's monitor
toString() – returns a string representation of this object
wait() – there are three overloaded versions of this method. It forces the current thread to wait the specified amount of time until another thread calls notify() or notifyAll() on this object.
