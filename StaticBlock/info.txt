Can you explain static Initializers in Java?

- A static initializer block resembles a method with no name, no arguments, and no return type.
- There is no need to refer to it from outside the class definition.

- Syntax :

static
{
   //CODE
}

- The code in a static initializer block is executed by the virtual machine when the class is loaded.
- Because it is executed automatically when the class is loaded, parameters don't make any sense, 
so a static initializer block doesn't have an argument list.


The static initializer is a static {} block of code inside java class, 
and run only one time before the constructor or main method is called. 
If you had to perform a complicated calculation to determine the value of x — or 
if its value comes from a database — a static initializer could be very useful.

class StaticInit {
    public static int x;
    static {
        x = 32;
    }
    // other class members such as constructors and
    // methods go here...
}
