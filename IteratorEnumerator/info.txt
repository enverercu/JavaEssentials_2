What is an Iterator and explain traversing through a collector using Iterator?

We can access each element in the "Collection" by using Iterators 
irrespective of how they are organized in the collector. 
Iterator can be implemented a different way for every Collection. 
To use an iterator to traverse through the contents of a collection we do:

- Obtain an iterator by calling the collections iterator() method to the start of the collection.
- Set up a loop that makes a call to hasNext(). Have the loop iterate as long as hasNext()returns true.
- Within the loop, obtain each element by calling next().
- The remove() method is used to remove the current element in the iteration.

Using Enumeration you can only traverse and fetch the objects, 
where as using Iterator we can also add and remove the objects.

So Iterator can be useful if you want to manipulate the list 
and Enumeration is for read-only access.

Iterator can traverse only in forward direction 
whereas ListIterator traverses both in forward and backward directions.
