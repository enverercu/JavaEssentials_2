Java is always pass-by-value. 
Unfortunately, when we pass the value of an object, 
we are passing the reference to it. 
There is no such thing as "pass-by-reference" in Java. This is confusing to beginners.

The key to understanding this is that something like

Dog myDog;
is not a Dog; it's actually a pointer to a Dog.

So when you have

Dog myDog = new Dog("Rover");
foo(myDog);
you're essentially passing the address of the created Dog object to the foo method
