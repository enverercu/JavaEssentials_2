What is difference between Java and JavaScript?

Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language and capable of running on 
multiple operating systems with the help of interpreter 
whereas Java Script is the object oriented scripting language and it is embedded in HTML and runs directly on the browser.

Java Script code is not compiled they are directly run on the browser.
