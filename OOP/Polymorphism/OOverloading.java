//Method Overloading is a Compile time polymorphism. 
//In method overloading, more than one method shares the same method name with different signature in the class. 
//In method overloading, return type can or can not be be same, but we must have to change the parameter because in java, 
//we can not achieve the method overloading by changing only the return type of the method.


//Method Overriding is a Run time polymorphism. 
//In method overriding, derived class provides the specific implementation of the method 
//that is already provided by the base class or parent class. 
//In method overriding, return type must be same or co-variant (return type may vary in same direction as the derived class).
